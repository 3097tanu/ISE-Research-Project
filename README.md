#### Identifying gaps and areas of improvement in career services for international business school graduate students

Optimization of support services for graduate business school international students, particularly in understanding their unique needs and providing robust career resources is paramount for career professionals.

In a 2023 report released by the Institute of International Education and the U.S. Department of State's Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs stated **_“the number of international students who enrolled for the first time in a U.S. college or university during the 2022-2023 academic year increased by 14%, building on the 80% increase in the prior year.”_**

When meeting with our career development peers in webinars and best practices sessions, the topics of how to best understand our international students and how to provide career resources (preparation and employment options) is top of mind.

Tiger Careers & Consulting and the University at Buffalo School of Management have teamed to conduct research to gather powerful insights that will benefit students, universities and employers to maximize the value and impact on and from students from a social, learning AND contribution standpoint.  We are running two surveys. The first is of career professionals, like yourself, so we can best understand the current allocation of resources and outcomes.

The second survey will be for current international students and recent alumni.  By better understanding the social and cultural transition of International students to the US, the onboarding of students into university and employer settings, and the performance of students in the university and employer settings, we will have a better understanding of their needs. This data can be used to help your career center plan for (and lobby for) future allocations. An email will be sent soon requesting that the survey be sent to your international students/recent alumni.
