# International Student Experience Research Project

#### Identifying gaps and areas of improvement in career resources and services for international business school graduate students


## Overview
The influx of international students in U.S. B-schools and universities has been steadily increasing, with a 21% increase in new enrollments during the 2022-2023 academic year, building upon an 80% increase in the previous year, according to a 2023 report by the Institute of International Education and the U.S. Department of State's Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs. This surge in international student enrollment has prompted career development professionals across institutions to prioritize understanding the unique needs and challenges faced by this student population and providing tailored career resources to support their personal and professional development.


## Objective
The International Student Experience Research Project was launched to identify gaps and areas for improvement in the career services provided to international business school graduate students with an aim to foster a more inclusive and supportive academic environment. The primary goal was to enhance the value and impact of international students' social, learning, and contribution experiences by generating insights to inform the development of more effective and personalized career resources.


## Project Collaboration and Scope
I worked closely with clients, including the University at Buffalo's Career Resource Center (CRC) and Tiger Careers & Consulting, and partnered with Purdue University. The project involved extensive business analysis, project management, stakeholder engagement, and data analytics, with a focus on survey design and administration, data collection and analysis, and the generation of actionable insights.


## Methodology

### **Project Planning -**
Developed a comprehensive project plan to guide the project's execution, including detailed timelines, milestones, and deliverables. This approach ensured effective management and timely completion of each phase of the project.

### **Requirement Gathering -**
Conducted in-depth consultations with stakeholders, including the University at Buffalo's Career Resource Center (CRC) and Tiger Careers & Consulting. This involved identifying and documenting their needs and expectations to inform the project's objectives and deliverables.

### **Survey Design and Data Collection -**

1. Survey Development -
    - Two separate surveys were designed to capture perspectives from two distinct groups: international graduate students/recent alumni and career development professionals from top U.S. business schools.
    - The surveys were developed in collaboration with subject matter experts, including career counselors and academic advisors from University at Buffalo, and Founder and CEO of Tiger Careers & Consulting.
    - The survey questions were carefully crafted to gather insights into the challenges faced by international students, the resources and support provided by career centers, and the overall experiences of both students and career professionals.

2. Survey Distribution -
    - The career professional survey was distributed through targeted outreach to career development centers at the top 50 U.S. business schools.
    - The international student and alumni survey was distributed through targeted emails, social media posts, and with the assistance of career center representatives from the same set of top U.S. business schools, ensuring broad and effective outreach to current international graduate students and recent alumni.

3. Data Collection -
    - Survey responses were collected using MS Forms, an online survey platform.
    - Participation was voluntary, and respondents' anonymity was maintained throughout the process.

### **Data Wrangling -**

1. Data Extraction and Consolidation -
    - Survey responses were extracted from the online platform and consolidated into a structured dataset for further analysis.
Data cleaning and preprocessing was done to handle missing values, remove duplicates, and ensure data consistency.

2. Data Transformation -
    - Categorical variables were encoded, and text responses were processed using natural language processing techniques to extract relevant information.
    - Derived variables were created based on the research objectives and hypotheses, facilitating deeper analysis.

### **Data Analysis and Visualization -**

1. Data Analysis -
    - EDA techniques, including descriptive statistics, data visualization (e.g., histograms, box plots, scatter plots), and correlation analysis, were employed to gain insights into the data and identify patterns or relationships.

2. Data Visualization -
    - Tableau was used as the primary data visualization tool to create interactive and visually appealing dashboards and reports.
Various chart types, including bar charts, line charts, scatter plots, and maps, were employed to effectively communicate the findings and insights derived from the data analysis.

### **Reporting and Communicating Insights -**

1. Reporting and Presentation -
    - A comprehensive report was prepared, documenting the project's objectives, methodology, key findings, and recommendations.
    - The report incorporated relevant data visualizations, poster and interpretations to support the insights and recommendations.
    - Presentations were developed to effectively communicate the project's outcomes to stakeholders, including university administrators, career center professionals, and representatives from Tiger Careers & Consulting.
    - Our project gained professional recognition at **the MBA Career Services and Employer Alliance Global Conference (MBA CSEA)** in Portland, OR, in June 2024, where our insights and recommendations were exhibited to a broader audience of industry professionals. This showcase played a significant role in promoting best practices for supporting international students, influencing career services strategies across multiple institutions.


## Insights
- 50% of schools reported that international students were less engaged in career services activities than domestic students
- 64% of international students lack clarity on what career roles are in their future
