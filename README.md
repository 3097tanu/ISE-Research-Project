# International Student Experience Research Project

#### Identifying gaps and areas of improvement in career services for international business school graduate students

## Overview
The influx of international students in U.S. colleges and universities has been steadily increasing, with a 14% increase in new enrollments during the 2022-2023 academic year, building upon an 80% increase in the previous year, according to a 2023 report by the Institute of International Education and the U.S. Department of State's Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs. This surge in international student enrollment has prompted career development professionals across institutions to prioritize understanding the unique needs and challenges faced by this student population and providing tailored career resources to support their personal and professional development.

In response to this growing need, Tiger Careers & Consulting and the University at Buffalo School of Management have collaborated on a comprehensive research project aimed at gathering insights to benefit international students and universities. The project's overarching goal is to maximize the value and impact of international students' social, learning, and contribution experiences.

## Objective
The primary objective of this research project was to identify gaps and areas of improvement in the career services provided to international business school graduate students, with a particular focus on supporting their personal and professional development and success.

## Methodology

**Survey Design and Data Collection -**

1. Survey Development -
    - Two separate surveys were designed to capture perspectives from two distinct groups: international graduate students/recent alumni and career development professionals from top U.S. business schools.
    - The surveys were developed in collaboration with subject matter experts, including career counselors and academic advisors from University at Buffalo and Founder and CEO of Tiger Careers & Consulting.
    - The survey questions were carefully crafted to gather insights into the challenges faced by international students, the resources and support provided by career centers, and the overall experiences of both students and career professionals.

2. Survey Distribution -
    - The career professional survey was distributed through targeted outreach to career development centers at the top 50 U.S. business schools.
    - The international student and alumni survey was distributed through email campaigns and social media channels, targeting current international graduate students and recent alumni from the same set of top business schools.

3. Data Collection -
    - Survey responses were collected using MS Forms, an online survey platform.
    - Participation was voluntary, and respondents' anonymity was maintained throughout the process.

**Data Wrangling -**

1. Data Extraction and Consolidation -
    - Survey responses were extracted from the online platform and consolidated into a structured dataset for further analysis.
Data cleaning and preprocessing techniques were applied to handle missing values, remove duplicates, and ensure data consistency.

2. Data Transformation -
    - Categorical variables were encoded, and text responses were processed using natural language processing techniques to extract relevant information.
    - Derived variables were created based on the research objectives and hypotheses, facilitating deeper analysis.

**Data Analysis -**

1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) -
    - EDA techniques, including descriptive statistics, data visualization (e.g., histograms, box plots, scatter plots), and correlation analysis, were employed to gain initial insights into the data and identify potential patterns or relationships.

2. Statistical Analysis -
    - Hypothesis testing and inferential statistical methods, such as t-tests, ANOVA, and regression analyses, were conducted to assess the significance of observed differences and relationships between variables.
    - Multivariate analysis techniques, like factor analysis and cluster analysis, were utilized to uncover underlying structures and segment the respondents based on their characteristics and experiences.

**Visualization and Reporting -**

1. Data Visualization -
    - Tableau was used as the primary data visualization tool to create interactive and visually appealing dashboards and reports.
Various chart types, including bar charts, line charts, scatter plots, and maps, were employed to effectively communicate the findings and insights derived from the data analysis.

2. Reporting and Presentation -
    - A comprehensive report was prepared, documenting the project's objectives, methodology, key findings, and recommendations.
    - The report incorporated relevant data visualizations, statistical analyses, and interpretations to support the insights and conclusions.
    - Presentations were developed to effectively communicate the project's outcomes to stakeholders, including university administrators, career center professionals, and representatives from Tiger Careers & Consulting.
